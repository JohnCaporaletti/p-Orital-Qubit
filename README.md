# p-Orital-Qubit
Code repository for paper entitled "Proposed Five-Electron Charge Quadrupole Qubit" by J. H. Caporaletti and J. P. Kestner

Introduction: This repository is split into labeled folders. The purpose of each is: (1) calcualte inhomogenous dephasing times for a single p orbital qubit, (2) optimize control pulses for two p orbital qubits, (3) caclculate the average infidelity of the optimize pulses due to charge noise, (data) engineered control pulse data.
