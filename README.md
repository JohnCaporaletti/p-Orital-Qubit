# p-Orital-Qubit
Code repository for paper entitled "Proposed Five-Electron Charge Quadrupole Qubit" by J. H. Caporaletti and J. P. Kestner

This repository is split into labeled folders. Folder 1): calcualte inhomogenous dephasing times for a single p orbital qubit. Folder 2): optimize control pulses for two p orbital qubits. Folder 3): caclculate the average infidelity of the optimized pulses due to charge noise.

Within each folder is both code and the data generated by it.
