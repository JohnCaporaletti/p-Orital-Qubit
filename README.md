# p-Orital-Qubit
Code repository for paper entitled "Proposed Five-Electron Charge Quadrupole Qubit" by J. H. Caporaletti and J. P. Kestner

Introduction: This code aims to do three things, 1) calcualte inhomogenous dephasing times for a single p orbital qubit, 2) optimize control pulses for two p orbital qubits, 3) caclculate the average infidelity of the optimize pulses due to charge noise. There are three folders labeled numerically. Each folder has a README that helps understand the code and it's relation to the paper.
